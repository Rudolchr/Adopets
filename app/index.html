          Our foundation is called "Give me home" and was formed in 2016 by a
          group of animal lovers. It all started with a spontaneous decision to
          “do a good deed” and donate some pet food to the shelter. However as
          we saw how much was needed, we couldn’t just tell ourselves “good job”
          and forget about the hundreds of hopeful eyes gazing at us. At first
          we were donating only from our own money, but as our good intentions
          were greater than our financial abilities, we started with fundraisers
          and so we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          However even an endless river of money won’t save all of problems, as
          long as there are still homeless animals stuck in shelter and waiting
          for a loving family. We do our best to help them find new homes. All
          of us have adopted and we are trying to inspire people doing the same
          by organizing educational events and placing ads on our site on
          Facebook. We are constantly looking for new ideas to help more animals
          ‒ there is still so much we can do!
        </p>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to find a home for as many homeless pets as possible.
          We cooperate with several animal shelters, other foundations as well
          as with individuals, so none of them is made to say “no” to an animal
          in need.
